🚀 Project Overview
The primary goal of this agent is to quickly and accurately retrieve information from a structured knowledge source. Instead of having employees manually search a large PDF or document, they can simply ask a question in natural language (e.g., "How many days of sick leave do I get?"), and the agent provides a concise, sourced answer.Core Problem SolvedEmployees often need quick answers to specific policy questions (e.g., leave, dress code, expense limits). Searching manually is tedious. This agent streamlines the process, improving efficiency and compliance.💻 Technical Stack & ArchitectureThis project utilizes a classic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, which is standard for modern question-answering systems.ComponentTechnology/ToolPurposeKnowledge SourceNovaTech HR Policy PDFThe input document containing all answers.Parsing & ChunkingPython (PyPDF, Text Splitters)Breaks the large PDF file into small, manageable text segments (chunks) for better context matching.Embedding Model(e.g., Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings)Converts each text chunk into a high-dimensional vector (a numerical representation) to capture semantic meaning.Vector Database(e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS)Stores the generated vectors and their corresponding text chunks, enabling fast and efficient similarity searches.Core Logic/PipelinePython (LangChain or custom logic)Manages the flow: receiving the query, searching the vector store, and passing context to the LLM.Generative Model (LLM)(e.g., GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Llama)Takes the user's question and the retrieved relevant context chunks to formulate a final, coherent answer.
